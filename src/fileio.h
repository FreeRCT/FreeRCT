/**
 * Base class for reading the contents of a directory.
 * Intended use:
 * - After creation (with the #MakeDirectoryReader function), call #OpenPath to open the directory.
 * - A new entry of the directory is returned with every call to #NextEntry.
 * - At the end, call #ClosePath to allow the object to clean up, and get ready for a next use.
 *
 * Alternatively, use #MakePath to construct a path you want to examine.
