/**
 * The text version of FreeRCT's revision.
 * This will be either "<major>.<minor>.<build>[-RC<rc>]",
 * "<commitdate YYYYmmdd-HHMM>.<vcs type><identifier>" or "norev.n000".
 *
 * The major, minor and build are the numbers that describe releases of
 * FreeRCT (like 0.5.3). "-RC" is used to flag release candidates.
 * Note: This format is not yet implemented in the configure script.
 *
 * The revision number is fairly straight forward. The first part is the
 * date of the last commit, in the format "%Y%m%d-%H%M", followed by a
 * '.', and then a VCS tag - 'r' for svn (including hgsvn and git svn),
 * 'h' for hg, and 'g' for git checkouts. This is finally followed by
 * the revision for that VCS.
 * e.g. 20130921-0929.r870
 *
 * norev.n000 is for non-releases that are made on systems where no VCS
 * detection was possible.
