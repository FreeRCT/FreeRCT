					<h1>Game Manual</h1>
					<p>
						In FreeRCT, you are the manager of a pleasure park. You build everything that your guests need to be happy:
						most importantly, rollercoasters and other rides, but also food stalls, footpaths, flowerbeds,
						and everything else that will make your guests love your park and spend lots of money there.
					</p><p>
						Additionally, you oversee the park's administration: Set the entrance fees on rides, hire and fire staff,
						take and repay loans, and even design your very own rollercoasters!
					</p><p>
						A wise manager will lead their park to fame and fortune; those less fortunate will go under
						amid dirty paths, vandalising guests, and crashing coasters. Which one will be your fate?

					<p>
						Your guests will move only on footpaths. To build footpaths, click on the 
						<emp>Paths</emp> button in the top toolbar and select a
						<emp>normal path</emp> type. Now click anywhere in your park and a footpath
						will appear. Right-click on an existing footpath to remove it.
						Building paths costs money and may only be performed if you still have
						enough cash. Deleting paths returns cash, but less than it cost to build the path.
					</p><p>
						At the bottom of the window, you can switch between <emp>single</emp> and
						<emp>directional</emp> path building mode. In single mode, a click
						corresponds to placing one tile of path. You can place paths only on flat terrain
						and suitably formed slopes. In directional mode, you can also build elevated
						paths. Click on the map to position the path building cursor there. Now use
						the four yellow arrowbutton in the path building window to choose a direction,
						and the three slope buttons to choose the angle. Finally, click the <emp>Buy</emp>
						button to build a path in the location indicated by the cursor. The cursor
						automatically advances one step forward so you can build a longer path quickly.
						Using the <emp>Remove</emp> button removes the last path segment and moves the
						cursor one step backwards. You can also move the cursor by clicking on the map
						or using the <emp>Back</emp> and <emp>Forward</emp> buttons.
					</p><p>
						Queues for rides can be built in the same manner as normal paths.
						Just select a <emp>queue path</emp> type instead of a <emp>normal path</emp>.
						You will learn more about queues in the <emp>Rides</emp> section below.
					</p>

				</div><div>
					<script>create_linkified_header('h3', 'manual', 'path-objects', 'Path Objects')</script>
					<p>
						Those paths are a bit bare, aren't they? Let's add some path objects.
						To do so, click the <emp>Path Objects</emp> button in the top toolbar.
					</p><p>
						There are three types of path objects available:
						<ul>
								 <li> <emp>Benches</emp> allow guests to sit down and rest.
									  This makes the guests happy and serves to reduce nausea and
									  tiredness. Two guests can sit on each bench. Benches can only
									  be built on flat paths.
							</li><li> <emp>Litterbins</emp> are used by guests to throw away wrappers
									  from food they bought. If a guest can't find a litterbin to dispose
									  of his litter, he will simply throw it down, so make sure there
									  are enough bins around! When a lot of litter has been thrown in
									  a bin, the bin needs to be emptied by a handyman before guests
									  can dispose of more litter there.
							</li><li> <emp>Lamps</emp> look nice. They don't have a
									  function beyond decorating your park.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p><p>
						Like almost everything in this game, path objects cost money to build.
						To build a path object, select it in the Path Objects window and click on an
						existing footpath. <emp>All</emp> edges of this footpath are immediately
						furnished with the selected object. Any other path object previously present
						will be replaced.
					</p>

				</div><div>
					<script>create_linkified_header('h3', 'manual', 'scenery', 'Scenery')</script>
					<p>
						Most of your park is just a featureless green plain. How about adding some trees, flowers,
						and other scenery? To do so, click the <emp>Scenery</emp> button in the top toolbar.
					</p><p>
						The Scenery window looks and behaves much like the Path Objects window.
						However, there are more items available for purchase, so they're grouped into
						categories. Use the tab buttons at the top of the window to switch between the categories.
						Click on an item to select it, then click on the map to buy it.
						Scenery items can not be built on slopes.
						Some items occupy just one field, but some occupy several. For items that are
						not symmetrical, the two <emp>Rotate</emp> buttons in the top-right corner of
						the Scenery window allow you to choose the orientation of the item you're about to buy.
					</p><p>
						Right-click on an existing scenery item to remove it. Some items (e.g.
						fountains) will return cash on removal, while others (such as trees)
						actually cost more money to get rid of.
					</p>

				</div><div>
					<script>create_linkified_header('h3', 'manual', 'terraforming', 'Terraforming')</script>
					<p>
						The landscape is still looking a tad boring. Some hills or cliffs would be nice.
						To add some, click the <emp>Landscaping</emp> button in the top toolbar.
					</p><p>
						The Landscaping window has two important settings.
						On the right are two buttons to increase and decrease the size of the area you will terraform.
						Below is the option whether to level the area or move it as a whole.
					</p><p>
						Modifying the landscape is as easy as moving the mouse over the park so the cursor
						indicates the area you want to edit and then using the <emp>mouse wheel</emp>
						to move the area up or down.
					</p><p>
						If the size of the terraforming cursor is just a single tile,
						you can also point at the corner of a tile to modify just a quarter tile.
					</p><p>
						If the size of the terraforming cursor is just a single dot,
						it behaves like the single tile cursor with one exception: In this mode,
						surrounding tiles will be dragged along with the tile or corner you're
						editing, allowing you to create large hills or valleys without cliffs quickly.
					</p><p>
						If you hold down the <emp>Shift</emp> key while terraforming,
						no changes will be applied and you will instead receive an estimate
						of the cost required to actually apply the changes.
						This works for several other types of modifications as well.
					</p>

				</div><div>
					<script>create_linkified_header('h3', 'manual', 'fences', 'Fences')</script>
					<p>
						If you played around with the various tools, your park should have a pretty
						nice landscape by now. For the finishing touch, click the
						<emp>Fences</emp> button in the top toolbar.
					</p><p>
						Building fences is as easy as it can get: Select one of the three fence
						types, then click on the map to build a fence segment.
						Right-clicking on an existing fence will remove it.

						Rides are the most important aspect of your park. So let's see how to build and manage them.
					</p>

				</div><div>
					<script>create_linkified_header('h3', 'manual', 'rides-selection', 'Rides Selection')</script>
					<p>
						To build a new ride, click the <emp>Rides</emp> button in the top toolbar.
						The Rides Selection window displays a list of all rides you can buy,
						sorted into several categories.
					</p><p>
						Clicking on a ride in the list displays more information about the ride.
						Once you have made your choice, click the <emp>Select</emp> button to start
						building the ride.
					</p>

				</div><div>
					<script>create_linkified_header('h3', 'manual', 'fixed-rides', 'Building Fixed Rides')</script>
					<p>
						There are two types of rides: <emp>Fixed</emp> and <emp>tracked</emp> rides.
					</p><p>
						A fixed ride consists of a single building, such as a shop. After you have
						selected to build a fixed ride, a window with a preview and the placement
						cost of the ride opens. You can rotate the ride using the yellow arrow
						buttons in the Ride Build window. Click on the map to build the building
						at the location of your choice. And that's it, the ride has now been constructed.
					</p>

				</div><div>
					<script>create_linkified_header('h3', 'manual', 'tracked-rides', 'Building Tracked Rides')</script>
					<p>
						Some rides, such as coasters, require you to build an individual
						track of your own design. After you have selected to build a tracked
						ride, a window with a list of all available track pieces opens.
						A station tile is preselected for you. You must always begin building
						a tracked ride by placing at least one station segment.
					</p><p>
						Use the yellow arrow buttons in the Ride Build window to rotate the currently
						selected tile, then click on the map to place the first station tile.
					</p><p>
						Now you can append more station tiles by clicking the big <emp>Buy Track Piece</emp>
						button in the Ride Build window, or you can change the type of track piece
						you're placing. The buttons at the top of the Ride build window allow you to
						switch between straight pieces and tracks with differing curve radii,
						between flat and sloped sections with varying steepness, between regular and
						banked curves, between lifthills with and without chain lifts, between regular
						track and stations, and much more. Note that not every coaster type has
						every type of track piece available, and not every setting can be combined
						with every other one. Play around to get a feeling for what's possible and
						what's not.
					</p><p>
						The controls at the bottom of the Ride Build window allow you to
						delete the last track piece and to move the building cursor back
						and forth. This is useful to correct mistakes in the middle of the
						track without having to delete unrelated sections.
					</p><p>
						Your track must always form a closed loop. Once that is achieved, you can
						close the Ride Build window to complete the construction phase.
					</p>

				</div><div>
					<script>create_linkified_header('h3', 'manual', 'ride-man-window', 'Ride Management Window')</script>
					<p>
						Click on a ride to open its management window.
					</p>
					<p>
						Newly built rides are not yet ready to operate. You first need to place an
						entrance and an exit. The Ride Management Window contains two buttons
						to do this. Conveniently, you are automatically put in Entrance Placement
						mode upon opening the Management Window of a ride that lacks an entrance.
						Building the entrance is as easy as moving the mouse to a free location next
						to the ride and clicking. You are then put in Exit Placement mode,
						which works the same way to place a ride exit.
					</p><p>
						Most rides need exactly one entrance and one exit. Building another one
						moves the existing one, if any. However, there are two exceptions:
						Shops do not have entrances or exits; the buttons are not available for them.
						And tracked rides need exactly one entrance and one exit <emp>per station</emp>.
					</p><p>
						The Ride Management Window allows you to change the colouring of your ride
						via the <emp>Recolour</emp> buttons. Which parts of the ride can be recoloured
						and which colours are available depends on the ride type. You can also
						change the type and colouring of the entrances and exits.
					</p><p>
						The <emp>Shop</emp> Management Window shows some statistics about the items
						that are being sold here. You can not change any additional settings yet.
					</p><p>
						The Management Window for all rides except shops allows you to define a few more
						settings: The <emp>entrance fee</emp>, how long the ride will wait at last and at
						most between ending and starting work, and how often to call a mechanic to
						inspect the ride. Inspecting a ride increases its reliability and reduces
						the risk of breakdowns.
					</p><p>
						For <emp>fixed rides</emp>, you can additionally control the number of cycles the ride
						performs, if the ride type supports this.
					</p><p>
						For <emp>coasters</emp>, you can additionally decide how many trains the coaster
						has and how many cars each train consists of. Your choices are limited by
						coaster type-specific restrictions and the amount of space available in the
						coaster stations.
					</p><p>
						All rides except shops have <emp>Excitement</emp>, <emp>Intensity</emp>, and
						<emp>Nausea</emp> ratings.
						Coasters additionally display graphs about the speed and G forces along the
						track. All these statistics are measured when the ride is actually working, so
						the values are not available initially.
					</p><p>
						Finally, the Ride Management window contains a button to remove the ride and,
						most impotant of all, traffic light buttons to open and close the ride.
						Your ride is closed initally. Click the green light to open it and the red
						light to close it down.
						Coasters additionally have a button to edit the track,
						and a yellow light to test the ride.
					</p>

				</div><div>
					<script>create_linkified_header('h3', 'manual', 'testing-rides', 'Testing Rides')</script>
					<p>
						It is strongly recommended to test your coaster before opening it.
						Testing causes the ride to operate just as if it were open,
						but no guests will visit yet. This will create the ride statistics,
						allowing you to see how interesting or boring your track design is,
						and most importantly you will see whether your coaster actually manages
						to climb all the hills – or whether it bounces back and perhaps even crashes.
					</p>

				</div><div>
					<script>create_linkified_header('h3', 'manual', 'ride-persons', 'Interaction With Persons')</script>
					<p>
						Guests enter rides though <emp>entrances</emp>. If a ride can not be entered yet,
						guests will patiently wait in a neat queue until the ride is free.
						But queues will only form on queue paths – if the entrance is adjoined to a
						normal path, at most one guest will queue. It is therefore recommended to
						connect the ride entrance and the regular paths via a <emp>queue path</emp>
						several tiles in length.
					</p><p>
						Guests leave rides through the <emp>exit</emp>. The exit should therefore be
						directly adjoined to a normal path.
					</p><p>
						When the ride is broken down or needs to be inspected, a mechanic enters the
						ride through the ride's <emp>exit</emp>. For coasters with multiple stations,
						the mechanic always picks the first station's exit.
					</p><p>
						Guests base their decision on whether to enter a ride on the ride's
						Excitement, Intensity, and Nausea ratings. Ratings are measured on a scale
						from 0 (boring / dull / not nauseating) to 10 (extremely exciting /
						incredibly intense / extremely nauseating); in rare cases higher ratings
						are possible. High Excitement ratings and low Nausea ratings are desirable;
						which Intensity rating is acceptable depends on each guest's individual
						preference, though very high ratings are tolerated only by very few guests.
					</p><p>
						When guests become hungry or thirsty, they buy food or drink from shops.
						Guests will also need to visit a toilet eventually.
						The information kiosk sells park maps, which aid guests in finding their way
						around the park, and umbrellas, which guests will be glad of in bad weather.
					</p><p>
						When guests visit a ride, they become nauseous; the more so the higher the
						ride's Nausea rating is. Nauseous guests throw up on the footpaths unless
						they find a First Aid booth or sit on a bench until it subsides.
