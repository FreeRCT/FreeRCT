FreeRCT aims to be a free and open source game which captures the look, feel and gameplay of the popular games RollerCoaster Tycoon 1 and 2.

Building the program
--------------------

Currently only Linux is officially supported, although Windows and MacOS *should* work. Let us know if it's broken.

Almost everything is written in C++, which means you need *g++* or *clang++* to compile it. FreeRCT uses C++17 features, so g++ 7+ or clang 6+ is recommended.
In addition, you need:

* *lex/flex* - Scanner generator for generating RCD input files. (optional)
* *yacc/bison* - Parser generator for generating RCD input files. (optional)
* *libpng* - Making the RCD data files that contain the graphics and other data read by the program.
* *SDL2* & *SDL2-ttf* - Displaying graphics of the program. Note that SDL2 versions of both libraries are needed.
* *CMake* & *make* - Building the program.

The existence of these programs/libraries is checked by ``cmake``.

Building is as simple as

.. code-block:: bash

        $ git clone https://github.com/FreeRCT/FreeRCT.git
        $ cd FreeRCT               # Go into the downloaded source directory.
        $ mkdir build && cd build  # Create and enter a build directory.
        $ cmake ..                 # Checks libraries are where they're supposed to be and replaces some strings.
        $ make                     # Let make do the heavy work.
        $ make install             # Optional step to install the program on the system. May require root privileges.


CMake accepts the following options:

======================= ============================= ================================================================================================
Name                    Default value                 Explanation
======================= ============================= ================================================================================================
VERSION_STRING          -                             Use this string as the build version. If not specified, the version is detected
                                                      automatically from git. If this also fails, the version defaults to '0.0.0-revdetect-broken'.
ASAN                    OFF                           Use AddressSanitizer (see below).
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX    '/usr' or '/usr/local'        Directory where 'make install' installs.
DEBIAN_PACKAGING        OFF                           If enabled, 'make install' uses a filesystem structure suited for packaging and
                                                      system-wide installations on Debian/Ubuntu-like systems. Otherwise, a structure
                                                      optimised for user-local installations and Flatpak builds is used.
RELEASE                 OFF                           Compile as a release build (works faster but is not suited for debugging).
USERDATA_PREFIX         XDG basedir spec or           Default directory where user data such as savegames is stored.
                        '~/.freerct' or               If not set, the XDG basedir specification will be applied.
                        '~/.local/share/freerct'      If ``XDG_DATA_HOME`` is not set, a platform-specific default path will be used.
WEBASSEMBLY             OFF                           Compile as a WebAssembly program that can be run in the browser using
                                                      JavaScript (experimental feature). May override all other settings.
======================= ============================= ================================================================================================


Note that CMake options are prefixed with '-D', so the full call is e.g.

::

        $ cmake -DASAN=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX='~/.local' ..
        $ cmake -DASAN=OFF -DVERSION_STRING="0.1~abc123" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX='/usr' -DUSERDATA_PREFIX='~/.config/freerct' ..


You can use the switch ``-DASAN=ON`` to link AddressSanitizer (ASan) into the executable. ASan is
a library that detects invalid memory accesses at runtime and terminates the program with a full
backtrace upon detecting one. This makes it a useful and recommended tool for developers and
everyone who wants to assist with discovering bugs. End-users should leave this option disabled.
You might need to create a link to the symbolizer before using ASan for the first time, e.g.

::

        $ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/llvm-symbolizer-3.8 /usr/bin/llvm-symbolizer


(the actual path may differ on your system.) See https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html for more information on ASan.


-  **src** directory contains the source code of the FreeRCT program itself.
-  **src/rcdgen** directory contains the source code of the *rcdgen* program, that builds RCD files from source (which are read by *freerct*).
- **graphics/rcd** directory contains the source files of the RCD data files, except the graphics.
- **graphics/sprites** directory contains all the graphics of the game.
- **bin** directory contains the actual *freerct* executable along with some other files required to actually run the program.
- **data** directory contains miscellaneous assets loaded by FreeRCT at runtime.
- **utils** directory contains miscellaneous utility programs and scripts that may make developers' lives easier.

The *cmake/make* commands above will generate the *rcdgen* program, the rcd files and build the 'freerct' program in the src directory.

Config file
-----------

Finally, you can optionally create a 'freerct.cfg' INI format file next to the 'freerct' program in the **bin** directory, containing the settings to use. All entries are optional. It looks like

.. code-block:: ini

        [font]
        medium-size = 12
        medium-path = /usr/share/fonts/gnu-free/FreeSans.ttf

        [language]
        language = nds_DE

        [saveloading]
        auto-resave = false

This means the medium sized font is 12 points high, and its source font definition file is at the indicated path. Make sure you use a path that actually exists. The language is set to Low German by this example, and automatic resaving of savegame files is disabled.

The actual font file is not that critical, as long as it contains the ASCII characters, in the font-size you mention in the file.

All supported options are:

================= ================= ==================================== ==========================================================================
Section           Name              Default value                        Explanation
================= ================= ==================================== ==========================================================================
font              medium-path       <installdir>/data/font/Ubuntu-L.tff  Default font file.
font              medium-size       15                                   Default font size.
language          language          system language                      The language to use. Use ``--help`` for a list of supported languages.
saveloading       auto-resave       false                                If ``true``, automatically resave all savegames directly after loading.
saveloading       max_autosaves     3                                    The maximum number of automatic monthly savegames to retain.
                                                                         Setting this to 0 disables automatic saving.

Running the program
-------------------

Now run the program

.. code-block:: bash

        $ ./bin/freerct

or

.. code-block:: bash

        $ make run

which should open a window containing the main menu (see also the pictures in the blog).

Pressing 'q' quits the program.

Use ``--help`` or ``-h`` to view available command-line options.

A detailed manual for the game is available `online <https://freerct.net/manual>`_.
